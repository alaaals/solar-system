      <h2>Project Update #1: Classes (10.23)</h2>

      <p>5 classes are used: SolarSystem, Star, Planet, Moon, and Asteroid.</p>
      <p>Each solar system should be a buffer frame on top of the main "galaxy" canvas. </p>
      <p>Each celestial body has properties including its position, mass, appearance, and related bodies:
        for example, each planet knows its moons, and asteroid knows which solar system it belongs to.
        Each celestial body has methods to set appearance and move.</p>
      <p>The solar xystem object keeps track of all its contents(star(s),planets(with their moons), and asteroids),
        and is in charge of displaying everything.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Things to do next: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Figure out the movement mechanism using gravity formula</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Project Update #2: Divided Task / HTML interactions (10.31)</h2>

      <p>Creation of celestial bodies are implemented through HTML interactions.</p>
      <p>The control panel div, consists of 2 parts: slider inputs for HSB fill color and size of the new object.</p>
      <img src="progress_images/progress2.png">
      <p>Then, by clicking on 1 of the 4 buttons above, the user can drop a celestial of chosen type by clicking on the solar system frame.</p>

      <br>
      <h3>Multiple problems to resolve next: </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Intergrate work from teammate (understand constructors to implement the 'create' functions)<br>
            scheduled a group meeting on 10/31 to discuss</li>
        <li>Determine display style of the main page (buffer frames, or clickable start representations)<br>
            scheduled an office hour on 11/1 to ask for advise</li>
        <li>Determine size of frame (embedded aside from the control panel / full screen under control panel)<br>
            (OH)</li>
      </ul>
